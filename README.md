# Mastermind Web Game
Re-implementation of my ruby Mastermind game library for the web browser.
It's on [heroku](https://afternoon-escarpment-72597.herokuapp.com).

# How to play
Guess a 4 color secret code.

Each guess gets a score of grey and white feedback pegs.

Grey pegs for correct position and color.

White pegs for correct color on a wrong position.

Good luck.
